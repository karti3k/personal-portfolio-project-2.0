# Personal Portfolio Project 2.0

## About This Project
I created this project as an update to my previous portfolio website. During my summer training internship, I was working with Next.js (a React framework), Tailwind CSS (a CSS framework), and TypeScript. Impressed by these technologies, I decided to update my personal portfolio to this tech stack, adding more features and an improved design.

Being a designer with some previous experience, I designed this website from scratch using Figma. I aimed to give it a cartoonish tone with a joyful theme, incorporating a playful font and color scheme. This time, I also included a dark mode to make it easier on the eyes, especially in dark environments. Based on my research, I chose not to include a skills section, as it's often seen as a red flag; instead, I focused on highlighting the tech stack used in projects to provide a more genuine representation of my abilities.

In essence, I was both the customer and the developer, demanding, designing, and developing a simple portfolio website the way I always envisioned.

### Inspiration
The navbar design was inspired by the layout of [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/), especially for mobile. The creations section, where I showcase my projects, drew inspiration from a YouTube channel named WebDecoded, particularly this [video](https://youtu.be/hYv6BM2fWd8?si=Uwa0r3XCAbKilqOJ), which also inspired my previous portfolio. This time, I aimed to give a unique look to the buttons, distinguishing between my frontend projects, graphic design, and video editing.

### What I Learned
As I was new to this tech stack, this project provided an opportunity to understand and implement these technologies practically, building confidence in their use. Here are three key takeaways:

1. **Next.js**: This powerful React framework simplified my development process with built-in support for features like routing and optimized performance. It seamlessly integrates with Tailwind CSS, making setup and configuration straightforward.

2. **Tailwind CSS**: This utility-first framework allows for efficient styling with pre-defined classes, eliminating the need for custom CSS and making design adjustments quick and easy.

3. **TypeScript**: Adding a layer of type safety to JavaScript, TypeScript helps catch errors early, improving overall code quality and maintainability.
